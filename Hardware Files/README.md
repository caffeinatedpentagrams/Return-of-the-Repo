# CODE WARS: Return of the Repo

**Colin McSkywalker** has returned to  
his home planet of **Anderson High School**  
in an attempt to rescue his friend  
**John Sperry** from the clutches of  
the vile gangster **David the Yanoshak**.  

Little does **Colin** know that the  
**FIRST Robotics Board** has secretly  
begun construction on a new **FRC game**  
even more **steam based** than the first  
dreaded **Stronghold**.

When completed, this ultimate **game**  
will spell certain doom for the small  
band of **programmers** struggling to  
restore freedom from **LabVIEW**...
